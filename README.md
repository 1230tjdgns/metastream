## Features

- Runs on Windows and macOS.
- Synchronized playback of streaming media across various websites.
- Public, private, and offline sessions.
- Support for P2P (WebRTC) and Direct IP (WebSocket) connections.
	- P2P uses [swarm-peer-server](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/swarm-peer-server) with 64-character hex public keys, called "friend codes".
	- Both P2P and Direct IP use client-server architecture.
- Real-time chat with peers.
- Queue of media requested by peers in session.
- [Timestamp cue points](./resources/screenshots/screenshot2.png) parsed from media description.
- Auto-fullscreen of embedded media players on websites.
- Per-user playback permissions, managed by the host.
- Basic host administrative functionality (kicking peers).
- Partial [support for Chrome Extensions](./docs/extensions.md).

## Questions

### Why Electron and not a web app?

There were two main designs goals in mind while building Metastream.
1. Support most media streaming websites.
1. Make networking resiliant in case any backend services go down. 

#### Supporting websites

tl;dr: Electron is more flexible.

To synchronize media on websites, there are two options: use a public API provided by the service OR inject scripts to interact with the media player.

In [past](https://github.com/pixeltailgames/cinema) [projects](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/gm-mediaplayer) I used public APIs. This works great for a few websites, but it doesn't scale well since most don't have an API or requires a lot more effort.

To inject scripts into a website, **a [browser extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) is required**. If Metastream were a web app, it would require browser extensions for each vendor (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.). On top of this, there's a history of extensions getting removed from vendor stores without an available recourse.

Browser extensions can [inject scripts deeply](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts#frames) in nested [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe). This is necessary for **websites that embed external media players** such as YouTube embeds.

Auto-fullscreen is a feature in Metastream in which video players on a webpage are enlarged to take up the full application frame. This required some trickery with injecting mouse clicks to trigger user gestures, something not possible with a browser extension.

Ultimately Electron gives more flexibility to interact with webpages to help make all web streaming media better supported.

#### Making it resiliant

Most web apps typically provide only one way to connect to peersâ€”using their proprietary backend service. If it ever goes down, you can no longer use the web app.

By using Electron, I provide **two ways to connect to peers**: WebRTC, prone to downtime, and Websockets, always available for Direct IP connections.

In the future, I'd like to investigate adding more ways to connect with friends such as using [Discord's Rich Presence](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to) features.

## How to Contribute

### Get the code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/samuelmaddock/metastream.git
$ cd metastream
$ yarn
```

### Run the app

```
$ yarn dev

# Open multiple instances for local network testing
$ NUM_WINDOWS=2 yarn dev
```

### Package the app

Builds app binaries for the host architecture.

```
$ yarn package
```

### Build notes

The version of Electron used in the release app depends on a fork which is not yet automatically used in the current build process. It can be manually downloaded from [samuelmaddock/muon](https://github.com/samuelmaddock/muon/releases). Once downloaded, place the ZIP into `~/.electron`
